  "occasion": "Andrea Bocelli's Annual Concert in Teatro del Silenzio",
  "description": "The Teatro del Silenzio is a natural amphitheater created in the beautiful setting of the Lajatico hills, born from the vision of Maestro Andrea Bocelli and architect Alberto Bartalini. For the rest of the year it lives up to its name \u2014 the stage transforms into a lake with a central platform where rotating sculptures are exhibited. A \"silent\" project, the space remains intact in its perfect harmony for almost a whole year, living for just a few days with national and international stars of bel canto, music, and dance.\n\nThis part of Tuscany sits almost outside mass tourism routes \u2014 rolling wheat fields, gentle hillsides, and absolute tranquility. Tuscany delivers beyond the concert. The region offers Chianina beef \u2014 Italy's finest steak \u2014 best experienced in Val d'Orcia trattorias. Drive the Chianti Classico wine route between Florence and Siena. San Gimignano's towers are 30 minutes away. ",
